# My First Blog Post

Welcome! This is your blog post template. Follow the structure below to write great articles.

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure a blog post
- Using markdown effectively
- Publishing to your blog

## Introduction

Start with an engaging introduction that explains what the reader will learn. Keep it concise - 2-3 sentences is ideal.

> **Pro Tip:** Use blockquotes for important tips or notes that you want to highlight.

## Main Content

Break your content into logical sections with clear headers.

### Section 1: Getting Started

Write naturally, as if you're explaining to a friend. Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences).

Here's an example of inline code: `const blog = new Blog()`

### Section 2: Code Examples

Use code blocks for longer examples:

```javascript
// Example function
function publishBlog(post) {
  console.log(`Publishing: ${post.title}`)
  return firebase.saveToDatabase(post)
}
```

### Section 3: Visual Organization

Use lists to organize information:

**Benefits of blogging:**
- Improves writing skills
- Builds audience
- Creates portfolio pieces
- Documents learnings

**Next steps:**
1. Write your first draft
2. Edit and refine
3. Add code examples
4. Publish

## Best Practices

Here's a table showing best practices:

| Aspect | ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Length | 300-1500 words | Too short (under 200) or too long (over 5000) |
| Headers | Descriptive headers | Generic headers like "Stuff" |
| Links | Add relevant resources | Link spam |
| Code | Real working examples | Pseudocode without context |

## Common Patterns

### Adding Images

If you want to add images, use markdown syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text describing the image](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

### Highlighting Code

Different languages are supported:

```python
# Python example
def generate_slug(title):
    return title.lower().replace(' ', '-')
```

```typescript
// TypeScript example
interface BlogPost {
  title: string
  slug: string
  content: string
}
```

```bash
# Shell commands
git clone <repo>
cd blog
npm install
npm run dev
```
