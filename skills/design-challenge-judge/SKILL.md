# Design Challenge Judge

Evaluate pitch deck designs using **Kevin Hale's YC Design Principles**: Legible, Simple, Obvious.

## Core Philosophy

> "Investors invest in teams, not slides. Your slides should make your ideas more clear."
> — Kevin Hale, YC Partner

> "If they can't read it, they won't be able to understand it."

**The Goal**: Help investors/judges understand what you do so they remember you. If they don't get your business, they won't remember.

## The Three Pillars (评分三原则)

### 1. LEGIBLE (可读性) — Can they read it?

> "Legible slides are ones that even old people sitting in the back row with bad eyesight can read."

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Font size: Title 100pt+, body 44pt+, minimum 20pt for footnotes
- [ ] Font type: Simple sans-serif (Helvetica, Arial, Inter)
- [ ] Font weight: Bold for key points
- [ ] Contrast: High contrast between text and background
- [ ] **25% Test**: Zoom out to 25% — is text still readable?

**Pass/Fail Quick Test:**
```
Can someone in the back row read every word?
YES → Pass | NO → Fail
```

---

### 2. SIMPLE (简洁性) — One idea per slide?

> "Simple ideas are ones that aren't intertwined with other ideas. A simple slide expresses one idea."

**Checklist:**
- [ ] One core idea per slide
- [ ] Maximum 2-3 numbers per slide
- [ ] No walls of text
- [ ] No competing visual elements
- [ ] If it needs 3 slides to explain → too complex

**Pass/Fail Quick Test:**
```
Can you state the slide's ONE point in 5 words?
YES → Pass | NO → Fail
```

---

### 3. OBVIOUS (显而易见) — Understood at a glance?

> "Obvious slides are ones that can be understood at a glance. If a stranger can tell what the idea is behind a slide, it's delightfully obvious."

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Main point is explicit, not implied
- [ ] No guessing required
- [ ] Labels on charts/graphs
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] A stranger could understand it in 3 seconds

**Pass/Fail Quick Test:**
```
Can someone who's never seen this understand it in 3 seconds?
YES → Pass | NO → Fail
```

## Scoring Rubric (评分表)

### Per-Slide Score (每页评分)

| Criterion | 0 (Fail) | 1 (Weak) | 2 (Good) | 3 (Excellent) |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Legible** | Can't read from 3m | Squinting required | Readable | Crystal clear from back row |
| **Simple** | Multiple competing ideas | Main idea buried | One idea, minor clutter | One powerful idea, nothing else |
| **Obvious** | Confusing, needs explanation | Takes 10+ sec to understand | Clear with brief look | Instant understanding |

**Slide Score = Legible + Simple + Obvious (0-9 points)**

### Overall Deck Score (总分)

| Category | Weight | Max Points |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Average Slide Score | 40% | 36 |
| Consistency (uniform style) | 20% | 18 |
| Flow (logical progression) | 20% | 18 |
| Memorability (5-7 key ideas clear) | 20% | 18 |
| **Total** | 100% | **90** |

### Grade Scale (等级)

| Score | Grade | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 81-90 | A | Exceptional — Demo Day ready |
| 72-80 | B | Strong — Minor polish needed |
| 63-71 | C | Acceptable — Several issues to fix |
| 54-62 | D | Weak — Major redesign needed |
| <54 | F | Fail — Fundamental problems |

## Red Flags (扣分项)

Automatic deductions for common mistakes:

| Red Flag | Deduction | Why It Fails |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Unreadable text (<20pt) | -5 | Violates Legible |
| Low contrast (gray on gray) | -5 | Violates Legible |
| Wall of text (>50 words) | -5 | Violates Simple |
| Multiple graphs on one slide | -3 | Violates Simple |
| Unlabeled chart/graph | -5 | Violates Obvious |
| Decorative images (no meaning) | -2 | Distracts, no value |
| Animations/transitions | -2 | Wastes time |
| Memes/jokes | -3 | Unprofessional |
| Inconsistent fonts | -3 | Looks sloppy |
| Inconsistent colors | -3 | Lacks brand coherence |
| Busy backgrounds | -5 | Destroys readability |

## Evaluation Workflow

### Step 1: First Pass (10 seconds per slide)
For each slide, ask:
1. Can I read it instantly? (Legible)
2. What's the ONE point? (Simple)
3. Do I get it without thinking? (Obvious)

### Step 2: Score Each Slide
Use the 0-9 rubric for each slide.

### Step 3: Check Consistency
- Same font throughout?
- Same color palette?
- Same layout patterns?

### Step 4: Check Flow
- Does slide order make sense?
- Does each slide lead to the next?
- Are the 5-7 key ideas clear?

### Step 5: Calculate Total Score
```
Total = (Avg Slide Score × 0.4) + (Consistency × 0.2) + (Flow × 0.2) + (Memorability × 0.2)
```

### Step 6: Write Feedback
For each category, provide:
- Score
- What works well
- What needs improvement
- Specific fix suggestion

## Feedback Templates

### Legibility Feedback

**Good:**
> "Typography is excellent — bold Helvetica at 60pt+ ensures readability from any seat. High contrast white-on-dark scheme works well."

**Needs Work:**
> "Font size too small on slides 3, 5, 7 (appears to be ~18pt). Increase to 44pt+ for body text. Gray-on-white text on slide 4 lacks contrast — switch to black or dark blue."

### Simplicity Feedback

**Good:**
> "Each slide delivers exactly one idea. Slide 5's single statistic '4+ hours/week' is memorable and focused."

**Needs Work:**
> "Slide 6 tries to cover problem, solution, AND market in one view. Split into 3 slides, one idea each. Remove the 5 bullet points on slide 8 — pick the ONE most important."

### Obviousness Feedback

**Good:**
> "Charts are clearly labeled. The before/after comparison on slide 4 is instantly understandable."

**Needs Work:**
> "Slide 3's graph has no Y-axis label — what are we measuring? Add 'Revenue ($M)' label. Slide 7's diagram requires explanation — add text labels to each component."
